# Inventory Management System 

Organizations use management systems to regularize their tasks. They can be simple or complex depending on the needs of the organization. An inventory management system (or inventory system) is the process by which you track your goods throughout your entire supply chain, from purchasing to production to end sales. It governs how you approach inventory management for your business.

The Web-based Inventory Management System will attempt to automate and replace the traditional paper based approach for inventory management and tracking which is being used in the Police Department. The paper based approach is quite tedious and it results in a lot of time wastage. Records would be created for each transaction and would serve as a central database where looking for a single record would take a few seconds. This paperless system of management would increase the efficiency, decrease the complexity and provide flexibility to the organization.
