  These are the terms we need to address:
 
 *  Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user, based on provided credentials. A common example is entering a username and a password when you log in to a website. You can think of it as an answer to the question Who are you?.
 * Authorization refers to the process of determining if a user has proper permission to perform a particular action or read particular data, assuming that the user is successfully authenticated. You can think of it as an answer to the question Can a user do/read this?.
* Principle refers to the currently authenticated user.
* Granted authority refers to the permission of the authenticated user.
* Role refers to a group of permissions of the authenticated user.
