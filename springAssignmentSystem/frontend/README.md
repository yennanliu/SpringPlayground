# SpringAssignmentSystem - Frontend

## Quick Start
```bash

# check nodeJS, npm version
node -v
npm -v

# update npm
sudo npm install -g npm@latest

# create react app
npx create-react-app web

# Success! Created web at /Users/yennanliu/SpringPlayground/springAssignmentSystem/frontend/web
# Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
#
#   npm start
#     Starts the development server.
#
#   npm run build
#     Bundles the app into static files for production.
#
#   npm test
#     Starts the test runner.
#
#   npm run eject
#     Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
#     and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
#
# We suggest that you begin by typing:
#
#   cd web
#   npm start
#
# Happy hacking!
